Custom vMenu to make sorting by manufacturers for addon cars possible.

A simple modification for the vMenu plugin by Vespura: https://github.com/TomGrobbe/vMenu

The modification allows admins of servers to sort their addon cars by manufacturers.

Installation:
- Drag and Drop the dll in "Custom vMenu" to your vMenu archive on your server and let it overwrite if asked.
- Optimize your addons.json and try to build the same structure as my example addons.json in "Custom vMenu".
- It is important that you do that ^

I included the source code of the modified files in "Custom vMenu/source code" if you wish to extend the modifications even further.
