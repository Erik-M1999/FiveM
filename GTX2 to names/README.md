# FiveM

A very simple python script to convert the GTX2 content to usable names.lua for FiveM resources.

Simply download the archive with ZIP download and paste your gtx2 content into the "insert_your_gtx2_text_here.txt" and then execute gtx2_to_names.py by double clicking it.
If Windows asks for what program to use simply use Python.
Finally, copy the names.lua into your resource folder and make sure that it matches what is specified as server script in your "fxmanifest.lua" or "_resource.lua"


Requirements: Latest python version

TODO: Make it an .exe to remove the requirements.
